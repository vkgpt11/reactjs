## What is the use of Hooks?
> Hooks are functions that lets you "**Hook** into " React **state** and **lifecycle** features from **functional components**.
- Replacement for class based components and states

## Why react hooks?
- Different way of doing same things.
- No More complex lifecycle methods
- Simpler code. No more `mapStateToProps`, `mapDispathToProps` with redux instead you can use `useSelected` and `useDispatch`
- Hooking into component is much eaiser.

## Rules of React Hooks?
- Only call Hooks at the top level
- Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions
- Call hooks from React Components or Custom Hooks

## Map Lifecycle class methods to lifecycle hooks?

|State Of lifecycle|React|Hooks|
|-----|------|-----|
|Initial Render|
|Updates|
|Unmount|
